### üöÄ My Learning Journey: A Reflection on the Masterclasses

The journey from Week 1 to Week 8 has been incredibly transformative. The masterclasses were not just theoretical sessions; they were deep dives into the core principles of modern software engineering. Each week built upon the last, creating a cohesive and powerful learning path.

Starting with foundational concepts like **Design Patterns** and **Data Structures**, we progressed into robust backend development with **Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices**, and then mastered frontend development with **React**. The hands-on approach was crucial, as it allowed me to immediately apply complex concepts‚Äîlike building a REST API, implementing security with JWT, or managing state in a React application‚Äîin a practical context. The sessions on **TDD, Git, and PL/SQL** provided the professional discipline necessary for building high-quality, maintainable software. This program has been instrumental in shaping my skills and preparing me for real-world engineering challenges.

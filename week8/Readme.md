# Week 8: Git & GitHub Hands-on Solutions

This directory contains the mandatory hands-on solutions for the Week 8 module on Git and GitHub as part of the Digital Nurture Program 4.0.

## Summary of Hands-on Labs

The solutions document in this folder provides a detailed, step-by-step summary of the five core labs completed during this week. The labs were designed to provide a comprehensive, practical understanding of version control principles.

### Key Concepts Covered:

1.  **Foundational Git & GitHub Operations (Lab 1 & 5)**
    -   **Objective:** To understand the core cycle of version control.
    -   **Key Commands:** `git init`, `git config`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git remote add`, `git pull`, `git push`.
    -   **Outcome:** Successfully initialized a local repository, configured user details, and synchronized files with a remote GitHub repository.

2.  **File Exclusion with `.gitignore` (Lab 2)**
    -   **Objective:** To learn how to maintain a clean repository by ignoring non-essential files.
    -   **Key Concepts:** Creating and configuring a `.gitignore` file to exclude specific files and directories from being tracked by Git.
    -   **Outcome:** Implemented rules to successfully ignore log files and directories, ensuring a clean working tree.

3.  **Branching and Merging Strategies (Lab 3)**
    -   **Objective:** To understand how to use branches for parallel development.
    -   **Key Commands:** `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`.
    -   **Outcome:** Created a feature branch, made isolated changes, and successfully merged the work back into the main branch.

4.  **Merge Conflict Resolution (Lab 4)**
    -   **Objective:** To learn the critical skill of handling merge conflicts.
    -   **Key Concepts:** Simulating a conflict by making competing changes on two different branches and then manually resolving it.
    -   **Outcome:** Successfully identified, analyzed, and resolved a merge conflict, a common scenario in collaborative projects.

The successful completion of these labs demonstrates a solid, practical foundation in using Git and GitHub for modern software development and version control.
